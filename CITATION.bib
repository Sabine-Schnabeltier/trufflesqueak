abstract = {Polyglot programming provides software developers with a broader choice in terms of
software libraries and frameworks available for building applications. Previous research
and engineering activities have focused on language interoperability and the design
and implementation of fast polyglot runtimes. To make polyglot programming more approachable
for developers, novel software development tools are needed that help them build polyglot
applications. We believe a suitable prototyping platform helps to more quickly evaluate
new ideas for such tools. In this paper we present GraalSqueak, a Squeak/Smalltalk
virtual machine implementation for the GraalVM. We report our experience implementing
GraalSqueak, evaluate the performance of the language and the programming environment,
and discuss how the system can be used as a tooling platform for polyglot programming.},
